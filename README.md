# Algorithm

Given two arrays (n1, n2), first merge these arrays.
Then find sort the merged array in an ascending order
Then compute the median of the sorted and merged array
Print the result


Performance: ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O(log(m&plus;n))) if `n1[]` has m elements and `n2[]` has n elements
